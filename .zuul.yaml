        # branch as well, which is pointless because these libraries are
        # frozen (more or less) in the stable branches.

        # The "tips" jobs can be removed from the stable branch .zuul.yaml
        # files if someone is so inclined, but that would require manual
        # maintenance, so we do not do it by default.  Another option is
        # to define these jobs in the openstack/project-config repo.
        # That would make us less agile in adjusting these tests, so we
        # aren't doing that either.
